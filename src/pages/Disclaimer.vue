            <br />
            <p>
              Local Terra is currently in the initial development stages and
              there are a variety of unforeseeable risks. You acknowledge and
              agree that there are numerous risks associated with acquiring
              Local token, holding Local token, and using Local token for
              participation in Local Terra. In the worst scenario, this could
              lead to the loss of all or part of Local token held. If you decide
              to acquire Local token or participate in Local Terra, you
              expressly acknowledge, accept and assume the following risks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions: The regulatory
              status of Local Terra, Local token and distributed ledger
              technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. The
              regulation of digital assets has become a primary target of
              regulation in all major countries in the world. It is impossible
              to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply
              existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to
              such technology and its applications, including Local token and/or
              Local Terra.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regulatory actions could negatively impact Local token and/or
              Local Terra in various ways. The Company, the Distributor (or
              their respective affiliates) may cease operations in a
              jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to
              law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such
              jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary
              regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. Inadequate
              disclosure of information: As at the date hereof, Local Terra is
              still under development and its design concepts, consensus
              mechanisms, algorithms, codes, and other technical details and
              parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although this whitepaper contains the most current information
              relating to Local Terra, it is not absolutely complete and may
              still be adjusted and updated by the Local Terra team from time to
              time. The Local Terra team has neither the ability nor obligation
              to keep holders of Local token informed of every detail (including
              development progress and expected milestones) regarding the
              project to develop Local Terra, hence insufficient information
              disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Disclaimer 13 Risks Failure to develop: There is the risk that the
              development of Local Terra will not be executed or implemented as
              planned, for a variety of reasons, including without limitation
              the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual
              currency or Local token, unforeseen technical difficulties, and
              shortage of development funds for activities. Security weaknesses:
              Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to
              interfere with Local token and/or Local Terra in a variety of
              ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of
              service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing
              and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a
              member of the Company, the Distributor or their respective
              affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally introduce
              weaknesses into the core infrastructure of Local token and/or
              Local Terra, which could negatively affect Local token and/or
              Local Terra. Further, the future of cryptography and security
              innovations are highly unpredictable and advances in cryptography,
              or technical advances (including without limitation development of
              quantum computing), could present unknown risks to Local token
              and/or Local Terra by rendering ineffective the cryptographic
              consensus mechanism that underpins that blockchain protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other risks: In addition, the potential risks briefly mentioned
              above are not exhaustive and there are other risks (as more
              particularly set out in the Terms and Conditions) associated with
              your participation in Local Terra, as well as acquisition of,
              holding and use of Local token, including those that the Company
              or the Distributor cannot anticipate. Such risks may further
              materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the
              aforementioned risks. You should conduct full due diligence on the
              Distributor, their respective affiliates, and the Local Terra
              team, as well as understand the overall framework, mission and
              vision for Local Terra prior to participating in the same and/or
              acquiring Local token.
